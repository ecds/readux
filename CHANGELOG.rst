  select an option to read the book online if pages are available, so that I can
  quickly access the content.
* As a researcher, I want the option to view pages as thumbnails to enhance
  navigation.
* As a researcher, when I'm browsing page image thumbnails I want to see an
  indicator when there's an error loading an image so that I don't mistake
  errors for blank pages.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to toggle to a mode where I can zoom in on
  an image so that I can inspect the features of a page.
* As a user, I want to be able to distinguish when I can and cannot use the zoom
  function, so I can tell when the feature is unavailable (e.g., due to image
  load error).
* As a researcher, I want to search within a single book so that I can find
  specific pages that contain terms relevant to my research.

Navigation improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* As a user, I want to see a label or source information for the collection
  banner image so that I know where the image comes from.
* As a user, I want to be able to identify a resource in an open tab by title,
  so I can quickly select the correct tab when using multiple tabs.
* As a user, when paging through a collection list or viewing a set of pages in
  the reading view, I can find the web page navigation at the top or bottom of
  the page, so that I do not have to scroll far to click to go to another web
  page in the series.

Integrations with external services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* As a twitter user, when I tweet a link to a readux collection, book, or page
  image, I want a preview displayed on twitter so that my followers can see
  something of the content without clicking through.
* As a facebook user, when I share a link to a readux collection, book, or page
  image, I want a preview displayed on facebook so that my friends can see
  something of the content without clicking through.
* A search engine crawling the readux site will be able to obtain basic semantic
  data about collections and books on the site so the search engineâ€™s results
  can be improved.
* A search engine can harvest information about volume content via site maps in
  order to index the content and make it more discoverable.

  so that if I am looking for a particular title or edition I have more
  information to identify it quickly without opening the pdf.
* As a researcher viewing keyword search results, I want to see titles
  or authors with matching terms higher in the list so that if I am
  searching for a title or author by keyword the item appears on the first
  or second page of results, and I don't have to page through all the
  results to find what I am looking for.

  I am in a coherent site whenever I see it.
* As a user I see university branding on the site, so that I know that
  it is an Emory University resource.
