        <h3>Static Site Export Error</h3>
        <div class="alert">GitHub Jekyll site export is taking longer than expected.</div>
        <p>
          Your website export has finished, but the site is not responding. You can check if
          the GitHub repository was created at <a class="repo-url" href="{{ repo_url }}">{{ repo_url }}</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible it still worked but is just taking longer than expected.
          Your site is expected to be available at <a class="ghpages-url" href="{{ ghpages_url }}">{{ ghpages_url }}</a>.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend trying the export again. If it continues to fail, please contact
          <a href="mailto:readux@emroy.edu">readux@emroy.edu</a> for help.
        </p>
