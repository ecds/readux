Static Site Export

GitHub Jekyll site export is taking longer than expected.

Your website export has finished, but the site is not responding. You can check if the GitHub repository was created at <a class="repo-url" href="{{ repo_url }}">{{ repo_url }}</a>.

It is possible it still worked but is just taking longer than expected. Your site is expected to be available at {{ ghpages_url }}.

We recommend trying the export again. If it continues to fail, please contact readux@emroy.edu for help.

For more information on using and customizing your site, see the
Github Pages help documentation at:
