'''
This manage.py command should be used for loading cover images into Readux.
Covers must be loaded before full page-image content can be loaded for a Volume.

This script requires access to the Digitization Workflow application; the REST
endpoint should be configured in localsettings via **DIGITIZATION_WORKFLOW_API**.
Running this script also requires that the image paths referenced in the
Digitization Workflow application be mounted locally at the same path, in order
to access and identify page image content.

Because identifying cover images and loading them into Fedora can be a slow
process, if you want to load more covers at once you may find it useful to
run the script in collection mode (load covers for a specific collection), e.g.::

    python manage.py import_covers -c emory-control:LSDI-RegimentalHistories

Then you can run multiple versions of the script in parallel, so that multiple
collections can be loaded at once.  It is recommended to use the ``screen`` command
to manage multiple instances of the script running on a remote server, both to
avoid the script being interrupted by a connection error, and so you can easily
check on and manage multiple instances of the script running at once.

.. Note::

    If the script detects that a Volume already has a cover image associated,
    it will simply skip it and not make any changes or re-upload a cover, *unless*
    the ``--update`` option is specified, in which case it will check to see if
    the existing cover needs to be updated.  This means it is entirely safe to re-run
    the import on a collection that has been partially imported or even all
    Volumes in order to pick up covers for Volumes that were missed previously.

If a cover has been detected and assigned incorrectly, use the ``--update`` command
with the specified pid or collection to try detecting the cover and updating the
record in Fedora.  However, if neither the data in the Digitization Workflow nor
the cover detection logic in readux have been changed since the last run, it is
unlikely a different cover image will be detected.

This script does have an interrupt handler configured, so if you need to stop
the import while it is in progress (e.g., if you know the Fedora Repository
needs to be restarted), first try a single control-c which will attempt to exit
cleanly after processing the current volume, and should report on what was
completed before the interruption.
